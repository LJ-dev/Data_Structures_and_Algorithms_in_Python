    "The ***adapter*** design pattern applies to any context where we effectively want to modify an existing class so that its methods match those of a related, but different, class or interface. One general way to apply the adapter pattern is to define a new class in such a way that it contains an instance of the existing class as a hidden field, and then to implement each method of the new class using methods of this hidden instance variable. By applying the adapter pattern in this way, we have created a new class that performs some of the same functions as an existing class, but repackaged in a more convenient way. In the context of tehe stack ADT, we c an adapt Python's list class using the correspondence shown in \n",
