By starting at the head, and moving from one node to another by following each node's `next` referecne, we can reach the tail of the list. This process is known as **traversing** the linked list. Because the next reference of a node can be viewed as a **link** or **pointer** to another node, the process of traversing a list is also known as **link hopping** or **pointer hopping**."

There is not an absolute need to store a direct reference to the tail of the list, as it could otherise be located by starting at the head and traversing the rest of the list. However, storing an explicit reference to the tail node is a common convenience to avoid such a traversal. For the similar reason, it is common to keep a count of the toal number of nodes that comprise the list to avoid the need to traverse the list to count the nodes."
